LogBot
======

A bot that runs as daemon and keeps IRC logs for consulting.

It currently is just a quickly hacked prototype that connects to an hardcoded channel and writes messages to a file.

Planned changes:

 - Improve overall code quality
 - Improve signal handling
 - Add SQLite db
 - Respond to requests made by users in the IRC channel
